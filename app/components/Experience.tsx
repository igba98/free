      "Interview.study is a groundbreaking AI-powered interview preparation platform I had the privilege to develop and own. This platform offers users an unparalleled interactive practice experience, enhanced by intelligent, AI-driven feedback and insights, which are tailored to improve their interviewing skills.\n\nMy involvement spanned the entire development lifecycle of this advanced full-stack applicationâ€”from conceptualization to deployment. I engineered a robust database architecture and crafted an engaging user interface and user experience, ensuring the application was both intuitive and efficient for users. Central to our platform's innovation is the implementation of a vectorized semantic search powered by large language models (LLMs). This feature significantly elevates the platform's capability to offer personalized experiences, enhance search accuracy, and facilitate more natural conversational interactions. The seamless integration of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline was a pivotal aspect of my role, enabling streamlined deployments and ensuring the platform remains cutting-edge",
